**What is this?**

I was a designer working on a project using Okta login. This Sketch file helped me plan/code our style changes. If you'd like to see/edit the live Okta widget, go here: https://developer.okta.com/live-widget/ 

**How do I use it?**

If you have Sketch, download this file, make your changes, review with your team, code your changes, deploy the login widget, party. Party hard.
